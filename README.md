# Neural-Network-for-Fast-Label-free-Nanoscale-Composition-discovery-of-Eukaryotic-Cells

This is the notebook I used for the data analysis of the Article: M.Checa et. al "Fast Label-Free Nanoscale Composition Mapping of Eukaryotic Cells Via Scanning Dielectric Force Volume Microscopy and Machine Learning", Small Methods (2021).

Structure:

  1. Importing Data
  2. Visualizing Data
  3. Preparing data for Neural Network
  4. Training NN
  5. Testing NN --> Generating Dielectric constant maps
  6. Saving Generated Data
  7. Calculating error as a function of the training size

Experimental Data Files are abailable upon request.
